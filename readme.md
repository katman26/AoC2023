## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual coding event that takes place in December, featuring a series of daily programming challenges. These challenges cover a variety of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving. Participants are encouraged to solve each day's puzzle and advance through the leaderboard.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific day of the Advent of Code challenge.

	AoC2023/
	|-- Day01/
	|   |-- Day01.csproj
	|   |-- Day01.sln

	|   |-- Day02.csproj
	|   |-- Day02.sln
	|   |-- input.txt

Each day's folder contains an input.txt file with the puzzle input, a Progam.cs file containing the C# code for solving the day's challenge, as well as a project/soltion for each day.
